      <h1>Results Week 5 21/11/2012</h1>
      <p>A big crowd turned up to see some great football. All teams were out to have some fun and all succeeded in that area at least.</p>
      <h2>Open</h2>
      <p>The first round of the Open competition has finished, and we are now in the race for a grand final berth. The unbeaten Gillenbah Dimmies have earned themselves a break to watch their competition slug it out to see if any one can find the form to knock them out next week.</p>
      <p>The Dimmies had a tough game only getting home by a whisker in the second half. The A Team was always in the game coming close to equalising on several occasions, only to be thwarted by some great defence by the Dimmies.</p>
      <p>Liverpool finally got it together and put four on the board to get over Pete's Team. With a score line that did not reflect the closeness of the game, the deciding factor was accuracy. Both sides had plenty of shots, but Liverpool finally got them into the net.</p>
      <p>Liverpool 4 (Jason Bowe, Daniel Alampi, Romain Papasidero, Ryan Dunn) Def. Pete's Team 1 (Peter Geltch-Kirkup)  Best: (Liverpool) Jason Bowe (Pete's Team) Peter Geltch-Kirkup</p>
      <p>Gillenbah Dimmies 2 (Michael Fondacaro, Adam Raso) Def. The A Team 1 (Ben Elwin)  Best: (Gillenbah Dimmies) Michael Fondacaro, Julian Mandaglio  (The A Team) Ben Elwin</p>
      <h2>Social</h2>
      <p>The social competition draw saw some mismatched sides playing each other, with some big scores the result. The Happy Chappies were down on numbers forcing Steve “Messi” Hottes out of the back line to take up the strikers position. Putting three into the net in one game saw him score three more than he did during the regular season, which helped the Chappies to a good win.</p>
      <p>XXXX played off against the Dyanmites. While out classed in the first half, team member and newly accredited coach Emma Dunn gave the Dynamites a quick tactics talk at half time. This gave them the impetus to come back in the second half and nearly cause an upset. With veteran Rocky Sillis putting his body on the line and showing the way with a goal, XXXX where able to stave off the strong finishing Dynamites.</p>
      <p>The Thunderbirds could not take a trick in their game, even the mistakes went in for the Killer Kickers. The scoreline never deterred the Thunderbirds as they had a great time and played the game in the spirit it was intended.</p>
      <p>Happy Chappies 7 (Kody Collins, Daniel Grundy, Steve Hottes 3, Luke Rimmer, Robbie Rimmer) Def. Teamo Extremo 2 (Adam Twigg, Justin Manwaring)  Best: (Happy Chappies) Steve Hottes  (Teamo Extremo) Zoe Dunn</p>
      <p>XXXX 5 (Macauley Harrison 2, Rocky Sillis, Brock Waters 2) Def. Dynamites 3 (Nathan Ciccia, James Iannelli, Isaac Papasidero)  Best: (XXXX) Ryan Dunn, Bryce Moore (Dynamites) Ryan Halden, Isaac Papasidero</p>
      <p>Killer Kickers 11 (Aiden Amato 2, Tory Amato 3, Ben Nardi 3, Sam Pirrottina, Patrick Tavella, Brady Valenzisi) Def. Thunderbirds 4 (Abbie Hurst 3, Angus Smyth)  Best: (Killer Kickers) Aiden Amato, Patrick Tavella (Thunderbirds) Abbie Hurst, Karena Holland</p>

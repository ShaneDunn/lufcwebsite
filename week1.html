      <h1>Results Week 1 24/10/2012</h1>
      <p>It was a great start to the summer soccer, with all and sundry looking forward to the next 8 weeks.</p>
      <p>Teams with the bye will be required to be at the ground, as they will be the duty team, and will need to help other teams who are short, until all teams settle in.</p>
      <h2>Open</h2>
      <p>The Open competition was fast with players using the increased width of the fields to great effect. With the introduction of smaller goals, the players took a while to get their shooting on target with a lot of wayward shots early in the games. With several of the their key players away, a severely depleted Liverpool lost to the enigmatic “The A Team”. The newly formed team has brought in several unknowns and is looking to be the dark horse of the competition. The Gillenbah Dimmies are back after a year off and started well with a narrow win over the fancied Manchester United. Manchester were missing their Korean import and his scoring ability will be welcomed when he gets back.</p>
      <p>The A Team 4 (Ryan Dunn, Otis Barney 3 and MVP) def. Liverpool 2 (Romain Papasidero, Johannes Kulle, MVP Anthony Mandaglio)</p>
      <p>Gillenbah Dimmies 2 (Joseph Fondacaro, Patrick Fondacaro, MVP Luke Mandaglio) def. Manchester United 1 (Trent Brown, MVP Emma Dunn)</p>
      <h2>Social</h2>
      <p>The social players took a while to get used to the smaller scoring target and the width of the fields. A couple of the teams quickly adapted to the new format and got away with early goals. Frank Porcu made his come back with Felix Joinery, along with another notable United stalwart, Rocky Sillis. The combination of youth and experience will get them to the finals, but the Under 14/15s team Killer Kickers showed the advantage of fitness in winning the first round match. The Under 11s team Dynamites had a successful first outing, beating the YAHS juniors the Thunderbirds, while the Happy Chappies continued where they left off last year defeating Dream Team FC.</p>
      <p>Killer Kickers 9 (Tory Amato 4, Sam Pirrottina 2, Aiden Amato, Patrick Tavella, Jake Shelton, MVP Brady Valenzisi) def. Felix Joinery 5 (Jarrod Sillis 2, Brock Waters 3 and MVP)</p>
      <p>Happy Chappies 10 (Isaac Collins 4, Jim Rimmer 2, Luke Rimmer 2, Kody Collins, Daniel Grundy 1 and MVP) def Dream Team FC 1 (Clay Pettit 1 and MVP)</p>
      <p>Dynamites 5 (Braiden McInnes, Ashley Williams, Darian Le Cornu, Ryan Halden 2 and MVP) def. Thunderbirds 1 (Alison Treloan, MVP Angus Smyth)</p>

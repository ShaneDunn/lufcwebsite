      <h1>Results Week 3 07/11/2012</h1>
      <p>A wet day did not stop to fun nor the spectators. While a field change was required, the games stated on time and the rain held of for the duration.</p>
      <h2>Open</h2>
      <p>The open competition was close with nothing in it at half time. Liverpool took on the Gillenbah Dimmies, and were in trouble from the outset with their fitness. The defensive efforts of Frank Alampi and David Edmonds kept the Dimmies down to one in the first half. With the Liverpudlian legs fading fast in the second half, the Dimmies scraped in a couple more goals to take out the game.</p>
      <p>Manchester United faced off against the improving Pete's Team. Manchester had a glut of possession in their half, but could not put the ball away. With several players out they failed to stop the quick counter attacks from the fitter Pete's Team who eventually got over the line.</p>
      <p>Pete's Team 3 (Paul Richert 3) Def. Manchester United 1 (Andrew Luff)  Best: (Pete's Team) Paul Richert, Scott Townsend (Manchester United) Nathan Lanham, Ryan Dunn</p>
      <p>Gillenbah Dimmies 3 (Michael Fondacaro, Luke Mandaglio, Adam Raso) Def. Liverpool 1 (Romain Papasidero)  Best: (Gillenbah Dimmies) Nicholas Trifogli, Adam Raso (Liverpool) Frank Alampi, David Edmonds</p>
      <h2>Social</h2>
      <p>The social competition had the top of the table clash of the Happy Chappies vs the Killer Kickers. It was one all at the end of the first half and neither sides supporters were confident of victory. The Chappies got up in the end, but had to grimly defend their lead from a Killer attack in the dying minutes.</p>
      <p>Dream Team FC are still coming to terms with the small goals, with several near misses. Scott White and Chole Preston combined several times to give the goal a scare. XXXX had their inspirational captain Frank Porcu out and had to rely on their Arsenal import to make up the numbers. In the end the Harrisons rescued a draw for XXXX.</p>
      <p>Teamo Extremo 0 Drew With Thunderbirds 0</p>
      <p>Happy Chappies 3 (Isaac Collins 2, Daniel Grundy) Def. Killer Kickers 2 (Tory Amato, Sam Pirrottina)  Best: (Happy Chappies) Sam Rimmer  (Killer Kickers) Jake Shelton, Lane Smith</p>
      <p>Dream Team FC 2 (Kieryn Little, Ross Marsh) Drew With XXXX 2 (Rod Harrison, Macauley Harrison)  Best: (Dream Team FC) Megan Dunn, Ross Marsh (XXXX) Rod Harrison, Brock Waters</p>

      <h1>Results Week 8 12/12/2012</h1>
      <p>There was a good turn out for the grand final. The crowds preferred watching from a distance in the shade as the afternoon was still very warm.</p>
      <h2>Open</h2>
      <p>It was the surprise packet Liverpool, coming from second last, playing against the favourites the Gillenbah Dimmies in the open grand final. Liverpool had to win three in a row to get the grand final spot. The Dimmies were without the Fondacaro brothers, but found Carlo Trifogli able to help out. It was a great game to watch. Neither side was given any opportunity on goal and the scores were locked at nil all at half time. It wasn't until late in the second half that Liverpool was able to break the deadlock, and hold on to win the Summer Soccer Competition.</p>
      <p>The battle between third and fourth started out fast but quickly settled as the teams felt the heat. It was a close game, although the score did not reflect this. Manchester where back on their game, one week late. It was Manchester's accuracy on goal which was the difference in the end.</p>
      <p>The match between the Social All Stars and The A Team provided the best spectacle and the the biggest surprise. Lead by Monique Higgins, the All Stars line up included a mix of juniors, seniors and very senior players. The All Stars were able to quickly get on top of the A Team and held the lead through out the game.</p>
      <p>Liverpool 1 (Anthony Mandaglio) Def. Gillenbah Dimmies 0 Best: (Liverpool) Jason Bowe,Daniel Alampi, (Gillenbah Dimmies) Luke Mandaglio, Carlo Trifogli</p>
      <p>Manchester United 3 (Trent Brown,Jake Single 2) Def. Pete's Team 1 (Paul Richert)  Best: (Manchester United) Trent Brown, Kurtis DePaoli (Pete's Team) Paul Richert</p>
      <p>The Social All Stars 5 (Monique Higgins 2, Hope Kennedy, Robbie Rimmer, Patrick Tavella) Def. The A Team 0 Best: (The Social All Stars) Monique Higgins, Hope Kennedy (The A Team) Ryan Dunn, Murray Weston</p>
      <h2>Social</h2>
      <p>The Grand Final in the social competition had some great goals and a couple of flukes. The Killer Kickers started well, but found it hard to get by the Happy Chappies defence. The Happy Chappies kept moving the ball around until they finally found an opening late in the first half. Once they opened the scoring the Chappies found a couple of new ways to score goals early in the second half and went on to win the Summer Soccer Competition.</p>
      <p>The third vs fourth match was one of the toughest of the day. Dream Team FC defended well with Megan Dunn hassling her brother Ryan and Brock Waters from XXXX, stopping them from scoring their usual one or two. The Dream Team girls combined to give Clay Pettit a shot on goal and that was enough for the win.</p>
      <p>The final between the Ag Thunderbirds and the Under 11's Dynamites was billed as the battle of the season. Unfortunately with school functions on, both sides barely had the numbers to take the field. In the end, with the Ag missing some key players the Dynamites dominated in a game that every one had a great time.</p>
      <p>Happy Chappies 4 (Daniel Grundy, Robert Limbrick,Luke Rimmer, Robbie Rimmer) Def. Killer Kickers 1 (Patrick Tavella)  Best: (Happy Chappies) Luke Rimmer, Sam Rimmer (Killer Kickers) Tory Amato, Sam Pirrottina</p>
      <p>Dream Team FC 1 (Clay Pettit) Def. XXXX 0  Best: (Dream Team FC) Ross Marsh, Stephanie Scott (XXXX) Darcy Single, Bryce Moore</p>
      <p>Dynamites 12 (Nathan Ciccia 4, Ryan Halden, Jamison Honda 2, Darian Le Cornu, Isaac Papasidero 2, Ashley Williams 2) Def. Thunderbirds 1 (Abbie Hurst)  Best: (Dynamites) Nathan Ciccia, Ashley Williams (Thunderbirds) Loren Gregory</p>

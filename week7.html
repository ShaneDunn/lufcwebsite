      <h1>Results Week 7 05/12/2012</h1>
      <p>The crowds returned and were rewarded with some great football. The underdogs pushed the favorites for a position in the grand final, and the Under 14's showed they could match it in the opens.</p>
      <h2>Open</h2>
      <p>After last week the grand final berths were wide open. It was a complex formula to fit five into two and some teams had to get it together on the night to win. In the end the favorites scrapped in and the Liverpudlians came good at the right end of the season.</p>
      <p>It was a very physical match between the Gillenbah Dimmies and Pete's Team. Pete's Team had to win by 3 goals to get in and looked the goods to do it in the first half. The Dimmies held their nerve and kept Pete's Team out in the second and scrapped home with a draw which put them into the grand final.</p>
      <p>Liverpool and The A Team had to avoid a draw which would have let Manchester in to the Grand final. At half time it was one all and neither team was showing signs of letting the other win. As the second half wore on, Liverpool found another gear and put their shots into the goal to come home the winners.</p>
      <p>Manchester had to rely on the efforts of others to get into the Grand final. Playing the Under 14's Killer Kickers, they still had to win to take any chance given. While the Killer Kickers were playing up a division to help out, they showed why they are one of the top teams in the social competition. Pushing Manchester all the way they acquitted themselves well and only just lost to the more experienced Manchester.</p>
      <p>Liverpool 4 (Daniel Alampi, Johannes Kulle, Ryhys Jones, Daniel DeSalvatore) Def. The A Team 1 (Otis Barney)  Best: (Liverpool)  Jason Bowe, Johannes Kulle, (The A Team) Gerard Harrison</p>
      <p>Pete's Team  (Scott Townsend) Drew With Gillenbah Dimmies  (Adam Raso)  Best: (Pete's Team) Peter Geltch-Kirkup, Scott Townsend (Gillenbah Dimmies) Anthony Trifogli, Nicholas Trifogli</p>
      <p>Manchester United 3 (Jack Inka 2, Nathan Lanham) Def. Killer Kickers 2 (Danyon Arnold, Ben Nardi)  Best: (Manchester United) Bryce Moore, Kurtis DePaoli (Killer Kickers) Danyon Arnold, Carlo Trifogoli</p>
      <h2>Social</h2>
      <p>The social competition lived up to it's name this week. With the Grand Final berths finalised two weeks ago, the teams are taking it easy and having a good time.</p>
      <p>The Happy Chappies and XXXX match had the youngsters being shown how to do it, and also how not to do it by the Elders of the club. Rod Harrison showed his son, Macauley, the error of rushing your shots and missing an open goal. The Chappies Steve “Messi” Hottes looked menacing in attack but found Ryan Dunn in his way each time he made a run. The Chappies got the early lead and held on for the win.</p>
      <p>Dream Team FC were missing a few players going into the match against the full strength Dynamites. The Under 11 Dynamites have improved out of sight over the course of the competition. Guided by the Under 18's Braiden McInnes and Emma Dunn, they were able to give their strikers plenty of ball. Dream Team FC had to scramble back to shut down the Dynamites attack and keep themselves in the game. In the end it was the accuracy of the shooting that gave Dream Team FC the win.</p>
      <p>Happy Chappies 3 (Isaac Collins 2, Daniel Grundy) Def. XXXX 2 (Macauley Harrison, Rocky Sillis)  Best: (Happy Chappies) Steve Hottes, Robbie Rimmer (XXXX) Jarrod Sillis, Rocky Sillis</p>
      <p>Dream Team FC 3 (Ashleigh Cook, Ross Marsh, Stephanie Scott) Def. Dynamites 1 (Darian Le Cornu)  Best: (Dream Team FC) Ashleigh Cook, Ross Marsh (Dynamites) Isaac Papasidero, Ashley Williams</p>

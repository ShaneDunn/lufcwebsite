      <h1>Results Week 2 31/10/2012</h1>
      <p>It was a great evening of soccer watched by an increasing number of fans. It was great to see some of the social players kick back, relax and watch the Opens' battle it out.</p>
      <h2>Open</h2>
      <p>The Open competition is still coming to terms with the smaller goals with plenty of near misses from long and close shots. The A Team looked dangerous the whole 40 minutes, but missed their top gun import Otis Barney when it came to putting it away. With the help of their Liverpool draft player, Manchester United should have won by more, missing plenty of opportunities in close.</p>
      <p>The Gillenbah Dimmies raced away with their game as Pete's Team got on the pitch for the first time. The Dimmies are really getting into the swing of things with good displays of passing and support. Pete's Team struggled to get the ball in the net with plenty of shots going wide. Their fitness was also a factor as the battled to get back in defence late in the game.</p>
      <p>Manchester United 3 (Andrew Luff, Braiden McInnes, Jason Bowe, Jake Single MVP) Def. The A Team 1 (Alex Blazevski 1 and MVP)</p>
      <p>Gillenbah Dimmies 6 (Patrick Fondacaro, Luke Mandaglio, Anthony Trifogli, Nicholas Trifogli, Joseph Fondacaro 2 and MVP) Def. Pete's Team 1 (Peter Geltch-Kirkup, Daniel Berghofer MVP)</p>
      <h2>Social</h2>
      <p>Everyone in the social competition again enjoyed the evening. The senior YAHS team, Teamo Extremo, had their first match of the season against XXXX. YAHS's Adam Twigg was harassed all game by Ryan Dunn, but still managed to score. It wasnâ€™t enough, as the Frank Porcu lead side has started to find the net, and the oldies let the youngsters get the goals again this week. The Dynamites had a tough game taking on the mighty Happy Chappies. They had their first outing against some of the bigger and better players and held their own. The Chappies stuck to their game plan and even got serious for a few minutes to take the points. In the final game, the junior YAHS team, Thunderbirds, also came up against their first big side. Dream Team FC had it's first win, and has started to find it's rhythm. The YAHS juniors did really well and improved on the field and the score board.</p>
      <p>Dream Team FC 7 (Ross Marsh 2, Chloe Preston, Scott White, Ashleigh Cook 1 and MVP) Def. Thunderbirds 2 (Thompson Helwig 2, Loren Gregory MVP)</p>
      <p>XXXX 4 (Ryan Dunn, Jarrod Sillis, Macauley Harrison 2 and MVP) Def. Teamo Extremo 2 (Adam Twigg, Justin Manwaring, Lachlan Pellow MVP)</p>
      <p>Happy Chappies 4 (Isaac Collins 4 and MVP) Def. Dynamites 1 (Jamison Honda, Isaac Papasidero MVP)</p>

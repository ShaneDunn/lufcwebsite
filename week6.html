      <h1>Results Week 6 28/11/2012</h1>
      <p>The first hot evening of the season kept the punters away as the teams slugged it out in the heat.</p>
      <h2>Open</h2>
      <p>The teams made it hard for the competition organisers with the bottom placed teams getting over their more fancied opponents. With one week to go before the grand final and the table turned upside down, it will come down to tomorrows games to see who gets into the grand final.</p>
      <p>Pete's Team started well and got a couple of goals ahead of The A Team before Otis Barney arrived. Arriving late, Otis quickly turned The A Teams fortunes around with a quick goal. From then on the game became tight with both teams showing a lot of passion and enthusiasm.  The A Team was not able to reel in the early lead and Pete's Team scraped home with a one goal win.</p>
      <p>The clash of the super teams had all the hall marks of a FA Cup final  Liverpool was out to make amends for the last round defeat and Manchester was there to put the Liverpudlians back in the box. Liverpool's Alampi brothers, Frank and Daniel, started where they left off last week with solid passing and good sledging. It was one all at half time and bragging rights were up for grabs. Down on reserves, Manchester could not stop the late charge by Liverpool, going down by a goal.</p>
      <p>Liverpool 4 (Jason Bowe, Anthony Mandaglio, Romain Papasidero, Ryhys Jones) Def. Manchester United 3 (Andrew Luff, Jack Inka, Ross Marsh)  Best: (Liverpool) Ryhys Jones (Manchester United) Jack Inka,Jake Single</p>
      <p>Pete's Team 4 (Peter Geltch-Kirkup, Daniel Berghofer, Paul Richert, Scott Townsend) Def. The A Team 3 (Otis Barney, Alexandar Blazevski 2)  Best: (Pete's Team) Paul Richert, Kabe Stockton (The A Team) Marco Pantano, Alexandar Blazevski</p>
      <h2>Social</h2>
      <p>With one more week of the regular season to go, the top teams have cemented their places. Being hotter, the games were slower and the cheer squads stayed in the shade.</p>
      <p>It was the under 10's vs the Under 14's when the Dynamites played the Killer Kickers. The Killers were too good for the up and coming United players. The Dynamites were unlucky to not get more goals, with several shots gliding past the posts.</p>
      <p>Dream Team FC got to play the XXXX's again. This time they were without their key defender, Scott White. With Hope Kennedy calling the shots, the Dream'rs were able to draw with the more fancied XXXX, who were obviously missing their senior players.</p>
      <p>The Happy Chappies put on a whopping score against the Thunderbirds. With Isaac Collins away, Daniel Grundy and Robert Limbrick were aiming for his top goal scorer title, only to draw even at the end of the night.</p>
      <p>Killer Kickers 4 (Tory Amato, Ben Nardi, Sam Pirrottina, Patrick Tavella) Def. Dynamites 2 (Isaac Papasidero, Najeeb Shafi)  Best: (Killer Kickers) Sam Pirrottina, Brady Valenzisi (Dynamites) Najeeb Shafi</p>
      <p>Dream Team FC 2 (Ashleigh Cook, Clay Pettit) Drew with  XXXX 2 (Macauley Harrison, Ryhys Jones)  Best: (Dream Team FC) Ross Marsh (XXXX) Ryan Dunn, Rocky Pirrottina</p>
      <p>Happy Chappies 17 (Daniel Grundy 7, Steve Hottes, Robert Limbrick 5, Robbie Rimmer 4) Def. Thunderbirds 4 (Alison Trelony, Abbie Hurst, Shaiejane Mackellar, Jared Hottes-Tweedle)  Best: (Happy Chappies) Robert Limbrick, Robbie Rimmer (Thunderbirds) Loren Gregory, Annalise Potts</p>
